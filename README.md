The Projects sheds light on how the size and spacing of solder joints affect their reliability and ability to manage heat. Here are the key findings:

Smaller Gaps and Heights: When solder joints are closer together and shorter, they trap more heat and experience more stress, making them more likely to develop cracks or voids over time.

Managing Hotspots: Tight spacing creates heat hotspots because it’s harder for heat to escape. Using better heat-conducting materials or tweaking how thermal interface materials are placed can help solve this problem.

Heat and Stress Go Hand in Hand: The study shows that as thermal loads increase, so does the stress on solder joints—especially in tighter configurations. This extra stress can wear them out faster.

Design Trade-offs: Designers need to find a balance between making devices smaller and ensuring their components are strong and durable enough to last.

Electric Current and Material Choice: The research highlights how different types of solder joints (like SAC versus copper-core options) handle electrical currents and heat differently. This helps engineers choose materials and designs that improve performance and longevity.

In essence, the project study suggests that smarter designs and material choices can go a long way in making semiconductor components more reliable and longer-lasting
